# ðŸ’» Calcify â€“ Web Calculator

**Calcify** is a responsive, browser-based calculator built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. It is a web adaptation of my earlier Java Swing-based calculator app and serves as a modern, interactive tool for basic arithmetic operations.

This project is built with a mobile-first approach, featuring a clean UI and real-time input handling. Ideal for learning frontend fundamentals and showcasing UI/UX design principles.
